A simple script to help people get more options compiled into vim on their Mac.

run
`./install.sh ruby`
for only adding ruby support

and run just
`./install.sh`
to install ruby, c, python, and perl support also

This script requires you to have mercurial installed already and install perl support requires an upgrade to libiconv (the script will do this for you)
